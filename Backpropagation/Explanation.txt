The neural network architecture chosen was 3 layers. One output layer, one hidden layer, and one input layer.
The reasoning for this was to attempt to recognize patterns or shapes from the input layer into the hidden layer.
The shapes would then, in theory, be used to recognize the each number.

10 output nodes were used: one for each number in the range 0-9;
12 hidden layer nodes were used. This was chosen to attempt to correspond to 8 directions of possible lines in the image, and 4 possible quarter circles that could be recognized.
64 input nodes were used corresponding to the input given.

The weights were initialized to random numbers between -0.5 and 0.5. This range was chosen as the trained weights were expected to be in this range.

The data input was split into 80% training data and 20% testing.

A learning rate of 0.05 was chosen through trial and error. It is small enough that it does not over correct while also being big enough to reach a result in a reasonable amount of time.

Momentum was implemented to avoid getting stuck in local minima.

Through trial and error it was found that when the global error sum was under 100, accuracy of ~95% was be achieved on the test data in a number of minutes.
